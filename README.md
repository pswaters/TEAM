# TEAM
Taxonomy for ETL Automation Metadata. A collaboration project to work on the managing (creating, updating, deleting) and validating ETL generation metadata.

The TEAM application ties in to the Data Vault tooling ecosystem (see overview here: http://roelantvos.com/blog/?page_id=1919).

I am addressing bugs and improvements as 'issues' in this Github. These issues are grouped into projects, for which I am creating a separate branch for each release. Once tested, the branch is merged and a new development branch is started for the next planned release.
